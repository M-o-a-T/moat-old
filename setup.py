HomEvenT is a scripted event handler, originally intended for home automation.
Needless to say, it *can* be used for other things.

HomEvenT features a roughly-Pythonic scripting language (with simple syntax
and event handlers instead of function calls), numerous modules for
additional I/O, logging, and easy integration into existing systems.
