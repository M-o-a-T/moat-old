homevent (0.2.5.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "delta up" to monitor, denoting a counter that doesn't go down
    (if that happens, the delta will be ignored but the counter will still
     be used)
  * Added conditional events

homevent (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed packaging.
  * Handle "busy" responses from the OWFS server.
  * Handle OWFS timeouts in non-DIR messages.
  * Use cached version of OWFS for directory scans.
  * Run as a "homevent" user (Debian packaging)
  * Removed the cdbs build system because it's buggy. See debbug 386970:
    calling dh_pysupport *after* dh_installinit is broken
  * Fixed syslogging.
  * Call RRD with specific seconds because it sometimes has problems
    when a datapoint is very close to the next full minute.
