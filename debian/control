Description: A scripted event-based monitoring and control system
 HomEvenT is a flexible, scripted, network-aware event handler.
 It can monitor and control quite a few external buses and peripherals,
 including 1wire and FS20. It can write values to RRD files and allows
 access to its command interpreter with SSH.
 .
 The author uses it as a central hub for home automation.
