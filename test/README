These are the tests. Every module should have one.

The tests don't use the unittest stuff; they do their work by logging
their actions. The Makefile compares real and expected results.

I did that so that, in early development, I could see instantly if any
change affects something internal, even if the outward result looks
the same — simply because the outward result might be too under-
specified, i.e. some changes mean there's a problem but the tests
themselves don't catch it yet.

TODO: re-visit that decision ‽
