====================
Schematics and stuff
====================

These are kicad files. Kicad is a schematics drawing and board layout
program, similar to Eagle (but free).

Hardware for the code in fs20/avr. Note that the schematic and layout
are well-intended and probably work, but they're completely untested.

The FTDI breakout board is available here:

because I am too lazy / shaky to actually solder fiddly SMB chips.
Feel free to modify the layout to use an FTDI directly.

My test setup uses a Boarduino:

Note that I do not use their boot loader; you'll need AVRdude and a
supported interface. I use this one:
