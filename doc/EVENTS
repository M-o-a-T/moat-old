Startup and shutdown
--------------------

startup
	-- after loading modules and parsing the configuration.
shutdown
	-- closing down

Module load/unload
------------------

module load NAME [params...]
	-- a module has been loaded (and can be used)
module unload NAME [params...]
	-- a module will be unloaded (any usage needs to be dropped)

State
-----

state OLD NEW NAME
	-- a state changes.
	   OLD is "-" if the state is newly created.
	   NEW is "-" if the state is deleted.

	   This event is triggered synchronously; while it executes, new
	   state changes on the same NAME are forbidden.

Wait
----

wait start TIME NAME
	-- a wait until that time (expressed in Unixtime seconds) is started.

wait update TIME NAME
	-- the wait time has been changed.

wait done TIME NAME
	-- the wait has completed.

wait cancel TIME NAME
	-- the wait is cancelled.

	TIME always refers to the time when the event is triggered (Unix seconds).

OneWire (OWFS)
--------------

These are low-level events, reporting a particular device. Usually you
are interested in actual measurements, reported in "data" events.

onewire connect HOST PORT
	-- the connection to this server is up.

onewire disconnect HOST PORT
	-- the server connection has failed.

	Note that retries are automatic.

onewire new TYP DEVICE
	-- The device with the given type has appeared on a 1-wire bus
	   for the first time. This event is followed by an "up" event for
	   the same device.

onewire up TYP DEVICE
	-- The device with the given type is now available.

onewire down TYP DEVICE
	-- The device with the given type is no longer available.
	   This may be a temporary condition. Until you see an "up" event,
	   however, trying to send polls or similar to it won't work.
