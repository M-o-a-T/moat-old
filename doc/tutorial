HomEvenT Tutorial
=================

-----
Intro
-----

This tutorial teaches you some basic concepts of HomEvenT.

It doesn't interface with the real world; instead, it tries to introduce
you to the way HomEvenT works.

It is not a command reference. See the “modules” documentation for that.

it is not a syntax reference. See the “syntax” documentation for that.

You can play with HomEvenT by typing “make i”, then “help”.

Input and output
----------------

Doesn't exist.

Seriously.

HomEvenT is not about reading the state of a switch from *somewhere* and
somehow, magically, turning off a lamp *somewhere* *else*.

That's incidental.

The main point isn't state, it's change of state. The fact that the switch
is on is not interesting. Often, you can't even find out.

What's interesting is the fact that the switch state changed. HomEvenT
then reacts to that somehow. One of the reactions may well be "send a
message to something-or-other that'll turn on a lamp".


Events
------

HomEvenT is, as the name implies, based on the central concept of an
event. Something happens, and HomEvenT reacts to it.

Example: Somebody presses the light switch. The light … lights up. ☺

Except, perhaps, if the alarm system is activated. Then, *all* the light
go on, and the siren, and the call to Security. ☹

Or except if it's an outside light and it's daylight.

Anyway, after the light has been on for some time, we might want it to
go off again on its own. Or when the dark storm clouds have gone away
and it's bright enough again. Or, surprise, when somebody pushes the
"off" switch.

All of the above can be represented by two things: "Events" and
"States". Events occur when something happens. States are what
the system knows about the world.

Changing a state is also an event. Or at least it can be. We'll get to
that shortly.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we don't have any outside world that
can trigger events, but we have a "trigger" statement which can simulate
one.

There's an "on event" statement which we can use to listen for events.

We're going to use the "log" statement to simulate changing the outside
world.

A complete list of pre-defined events is available in the “events”
documentation file.


Simple case
-----------

Make the light go on.

	>> load trigger
	>> load logging
	>> load on_event
	>> log debug

	# let the external switch cause "pushed on sw1" and 
	# "pushed off sw1" events
	>> on pushed on sw1:
		log DEBUG "turn on lamp1"
	>> on pushed off sw1:
		log DEBUG "turn off lamp1"
	.
	>> trigger pushed on sw1
	DEBUG> turn on lamp1

That was easy, but you don't need a computer for that.


Toggle switches
---------------

The first complication is that push-button switches are easier to do
than on/off switches when you talk to computers, because the computer
only needs to understand one kind of event (a button is pressed) instead
of two (switch on vs. switch off). So are remote controls because the
number of buttons on them is limited; we'd like to be able to control
four lights with a four-button remote, not just two.

On the other hand, while toggle relays (to control the lights) do exist,
they're more expensive, less reliable, and the computer never really
knows what their actual state is unless it has a light sensor next to
the lamp..

Thus, we need to remember what the state is supposed to be. Sometimes
the external hardware does that for us (i.e., you can ask the relay
controller whether Relay#5 is currently on or off), but not always — and
frankly, I want the computer to be in charge of the external gizmos,
not the other way 'round.

Fortunately, there's a module for state handling.

Let's improve the previous example:

	>> load state
	>> set state off lamp1
	>> on pushed toggle sw1:
		if state on lamp1:
			set state off lamp1
			log DEBUG "turn off lamp1"
		else:
			set state on lamp1
			log DEBUG "turn on lamp1"
	.
	>> trigger pushed toggle sw1
	DEBUG> turn on lamp1
	>> trigger pushed toggle sw1
	DEBUG> turn off lamp1

That was almost too easy, but we're not done yet.


Modularization
--------------

For starters, most systems aren't quite that simple: you want more
switches, some of which might control more than one lamp. It's not a
good idea to give all your switches the same name even if they happen to
do the same thing *now*: you can't change things later.

The easy solution would be to duplicate the above code a whole lot,
but that's not a good idea. You lose track of what-does-what rather
easily, when you do change stuff you forget a crucial place or two,
and a year later you discover that turning off the bathroom light also
turns on the central heating — so that's why you're sweating in bed all
the time. Oops.

A better solution hangs off noting the fact that the above event
statements control two things — they set the internal state *and*
switch the external lamp. We need to separate that.

For starters, we can divorce the idea "the switch controls the lamp"
from "the lamp gets turned on or off":

	>> on pushed toggle sw1:
		trigger toggle lamp1
	.
	>> on toggle lamp1:
		if state on lamp1:
			set state off lamp1
			log DEBUG "turn off lamp1"
		else:
			set state on lamp1
			log DEBUG "turn on lamp1"
	.

Now the switch part looks like it's handled. The lamp part still looks
like it needs polishing, though, because if you have 100 lamps …

Fortunately, events can have placeholders. They look like this:

	>> on toggle *lamp:
		if not exists state $lamp:
			set state off $lamp
		if state on $lamp:
			set state off $lamp
			log DEBUG "turn off" $lamp
		else:
			set state on $lamp
			log DEBUG "turn on" $lamp
	.

That works for every lamp there is, and it even auto-creates an initial
state if you forgot to do that manually (otherwise you'll get a cryptic
error message instead of a lit lamp).

Note that the quoting changed in the "log DEBUG" statements. The reason
for that is the HomEvenT is stupid by design, and replaces those $things
only when they're on their own.

Oops
----

Unfortunately, that simple "on toggle" wildcard means that if we ever
want to toggle things that are not lamps, the whole thing will get
horribly confused.

There's no way to say "on toggle lamp*lamp" or whatever, in order to
react only to events whose names start with the four characters "lamp".
That's intentional, because there's a better way: after all, nobody said
event names (and state names) can only consist of one word.

	>> on pushed toggle sw1:
		trigger toggle lamp lamp1
	.
	>> on toggle lamp *lamp:
		if not exists state lamp $lamp:
			set state off lamp $lamp
		if state on lamp $lamp:
			set state off lamp $lamp
			log DEBUG "turn off lamp" $lamp
		else:
			set state on $lamp
			log DEBUG "turn on lamp" $lamp
	.

That's better.

State change events
-------------------

However, there's still the problem that everywhere we change a lamp, we
must not forget to also change the corresponding state, and vice
versa. That's still tedious and error-prone.

The solution is that state changes also trigger events, which get
created by HomEvenT internally. Thus, we can do this instead:

	>> on toggle lamp *lamp:
		if not exists state lamp $lamp:
			set state off lamp $lamp
		if state on lamp $lamp:
			set state off lamp $lamp
		else:
			set state on $lamp
	
	on state * on lamp *lamp:
		log DEBUG "turn on lamp" $lamp
	on state * off lamp *lamp:
		log DEBUG "turn off lamp" $lamp
	.

The single star means "I don't care"; it represents the old value of the
state. Check the “events” documentation for details.

Auto-turn-off
-------------

The easy (but wrong) solution is:

	>> load wait
	>> on toggle lamp *lamp:
		set state on $lamp
		wait: for 5 min
		set state off lamp $lamp
	.
	>> # THE ABOVE EXAMPLE WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY

The problem is: what happens when somebody presses the switch again
during those five minutes? Do you want the thing turned off now, stay on
for the original five minutes, stay on for the new five minutes, or stay
on for a total of ten minutes? Depending on your preferences, all of
those might make sense.

What does *not* make sense is the behavior of the above code, which
makes the lamp go out five minutes after *any* button press. Consider:

* now: I push the button. Lamp lights.

* 1min: You push the button by accident because you habitually do that
  every time you enter the room. Of course, nothing happens because the
  lamp is already on.

* 5min: The light goes out (from the first push). You still need it,
  though, and so you turn it on again.

* 6min: The light goes out (second push). You start to wonder why the
  damn thing won't stay on, and push the button again.

* 10min: The light goes out again (third push). You wonder what happened
  to the five-minute-promise, grumble about the randomness of it all,
  and turn the light back on.

* 11min: Oops, it's dark again. You get pissed off about the timer and
  forward your annoyance to the author of the above code. Said author
  looks at the code, sees that it's “obviously correct”, deletes HomEvenT
  and spends a ton of money on a proprietary system. The end.


Anyway, let's continue with solutions that actually work.

First solution: turn the thing off.

	>> on toggle lamp *lamp:
		if state on lamp $lamp:
			del wait lamp $lamp
		else:
			set state on lamp $lamp
			wait lamp $lamp:
                for 5 min
		set state off lamp $lamp
	.

(For your own interactive tests, you may want to reduce the "5 min"
timer to something less boring.)

Watch what happens. The first time the button is pressed, the "else:"
part is executed: the lamp gets turned on and the wait gets started.
The "set state off" command sits in the to-be-done queue behind the
"wait" and, well, waits.

If you press the button again before the time is up, the "del wait"
cancels the original wait statement plus (this is the important part)
everything else that was sitting around waiting for it to finish. So
the original "set state off" command is now forgotten. Fortunately,
the "set state off" from the second button press is still there.
End result: The light goes off.

We might be able to improve this code, which again becomes important
when you design bigger and better systems. The subtle point is that you
shouldn't base your decision on the current state of the lamp, but the
fact that you have a change-of-lamp-state pending. So, instead of

	if state on lamp $lamp:

you might want to write

	if exists wait lamp $lamp:

The difference obviously doesn't matter in this simple snippet;
depending on how you structure your code, the one or the other way
of doing this may make more sense.

NB: The name spaces of "state" and "wait" are separate. For convenience
I've named both the same in the above code snippet, but they aren't
related in any way (except by your code, of course).


Second solution: Keep the original timeout, i.e. do nothing.

This is absurdly simple.

	>> on toggle lamp *lamp:
		if not state on lamp $lamp:
			set state on lamp $lamp
			wait lamp $lamp:
                for 5 min
			set state off lamp $lamp
	.

Note that here, I intentionally use the "if state on" decision because I
want that switch to be dead whenever the lamp is on, not just because
I'm waiting for it to turn itself off. Again, if you have a larger
system with alternate means to control your lamp, things may be
different.


Third solution: re-start the timer.

	>> on toggle lamp *lamp:
		if exists wait lamp $lamp:
			wait lamp $lamp:
                for 5 min
				update
		else:
			set state on lamp $lamp
			wait lamp $lamp:
                for 5 min
			set state off lamp $lamp
	.

Here I use the "update" keyword in "wait". This tells the wait
statement to go to the version of the (named!) wait that's already
running and play with that, instead of waiting itself.


Fourth solution: extend the time. That's easy, we just need to figure 
out when the lamp should originally have been turned off, and base our
new timeout on that. 

	>> on toggle lamp *lamp:
		if exists wait lamp $lamp:
			var wait timeout wait lamp $lamp
			wait lamp $lamp:
                for $timeout 5 min
				update
		else:
			set state on lamp $lamp
			wait lamp $lamp:
                for $timeout 5 min
			set state off lamp $lamp
	.

You might want to implement a second timer which controls the maximum
length the lamp will stay on. Again, you decide whether that timer
should run from the first or last button press.


Alternate solution
------------------

You might want to attach the fact that the lamp should go off to the
turn-on event instead. The distinction is whether you want the lamp to
*always* turn off after five minutes, or just because it's been
switched on by somebody. If you only have manual switches, the
distinction is meaningless, but you might also have motion detectors
or daylight sensors or some other way of presence detection (e.g., when
first the outside door sensor and then the bedroom door sensor fire,
it's reasonable to assume that somebody must be *somewhere* in your home).

Anyway, in principle, this is easy:

	>> on state * on lamp *lamp:
		prio 80
		wait 5 min:
			name lamp $lamp
		set state off lamp $lamp
	. 
	>> # THE ABOVE EXAMPLE WILL NOT WORK

Unfortunately, this solution will crash with a nasty error message
instead of turning the light off.

The reason for that disaster is that state-change events are running
synchronously, i.e. the "set state" command waits for them to complete
before continuing. They're also forbidden to change the state they're
reporting about; otherwise you could get cute endless ping-pong effects.
(Actually, that problem exists regardless … but at least the main cause
of such chains is broken.)

The solution is an "async:" block, which is just a normal block that
doesn't force the rest of the world to wait until the statements inside
(which are still run in sequence!) complete:

	>> on state * on lamp *lamp:
		prio 80
		async:
			wait 5 min:
				name lamp $lamp
			set state off lamp $lamp
	.

Exercise: Of course, you need a “on state * off …” block to cancel the
timer, but by now you should be able to write that yourself.
