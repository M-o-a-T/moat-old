Help

Group all "list" statements so that the global overview shows only one
line.

Improve the help messages.

Dump config
===========

Each module should be able to print some text that will, when read back
in, re-create the system state as accurately as possible.

* order is important: modules then event handlers, then everything else,
  except that connections are last

  - wait handlers cannot be restored because there's no way to sanely
    jump back into the execution structure

  - need to require that wait handlers get properly restarted by code

syslog
======

Instead of printing to stdout/stderr, log.

* use some standard logging interface

  - Python, or Twisted?

LIRC
====

* Recognize infrared commands (and send them).

  - connect to /dev/lircd, or a remote socket

* generate LIRC commands 

  - this requires that the lircd server connects to *us*.

Parser
======

* Write a (yapps2-based) parser with decent grammar
  instead of the current mess

* Add some ability to create a macro handler
  so that similar code needs to be written only once

  - requires to store code more sensibly before executing any of it
