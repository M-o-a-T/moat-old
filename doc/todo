Dump config
===========

Each module should be able to print some text that will, when read back
in, re-create the system state as accurately as possible.

* order is important: modules then event handlers, then everything else,
  except that connections are last
  - wait handlers cannot be restored because there's no way to sanely
    jump back into the execution structure
  - need to require that wait handlers get properly restarted by code

syslog
======

Instead of printing to stdout/stderr, log.

* use some standard logging interface
  - Python, or Twisted?

LIRC
====

* Recognize infrared commands (and send them).
  - connect to /dev/lircd, or a remote socket

* generate LIRC commands 
  - this requires that the lircd server connects to *us*.

Parser
======

Write a (yapps2-based) parser with decent grammar
instead of the current mess
